Nipype 2012: more packages, more reusable workflows and more reproducible research
==================================================================================

Nipype has enabled users to efficiently process and analyze large and diverse
neuroimaging data using a combination of tools from several sophisticated
software packages (e.g., AFNI, FSL, FreeSurfer, NiPy, SPM). This Python-based
neuroimaging framework allows replicable, efficient and optimal use of
neuroimaging tools. It provides semantically uniform access to underlying
software (whether written in C/C++, Matlab, Python or Java) and a scriptable
workflow creation and execution engine that supports local or distributed
computation.  Nipype has grown in terms of features, developers, and users.

Nipype addresses the problem of interacting with neuroimaging software in a
sustainable and open manner. All source code (BSD licensed) and the complete
history are accessible to everyone. Code modifications are reviewed and tested
before merging. Discussions and design decisions are done on an open access
mailing list, encouraging a broader community of developers to join and allows
sharing of the development resources (effort, money, information and time).

During this why, what & how you will learn the basics of Nipype for brain
imaging analysis. I will explain how Nipype can be used as a simple library and
also how to use it to do analyses of real world projects. I will demonstrate
why Nipype, a Python based framework, is a serious alternative to shell
scripting, matlab scripting and/or other GUIs. If time permits, I will discuss
some of the future directions for development.
