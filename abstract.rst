During this why, what & how you will learn the basics of Nipype for brain
imaging analysis. I will explain how Nipype can be used as a simple library and
also how to use it to do analyses of real world projects. Nipype is a Python
based framework and comes with extensive brain imaging software support and
workflow creation and execution support making it a serious alternative to
bash scripting/matlab scripting and GUIs. If time permits I will demo some neat
features of Nipype like distributed computing.
